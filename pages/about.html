          My hobbies gravitate together the highs and lows of technology. In
          this madly and rapidly advancing age of the cutting-edge and next big
          technological breakthrough, I love finding new comfortable places to
          toy with what are seen as today's basic and fundamental elements,
          which themselves served as the technological forefront of the recent
          past.

          With precise control of the smallest bits of space and time, we can
          erect and erode entire universes. This is how I create-- one bit at a
          time. Seurat spent his Sunday afternoons with tiny points of paint on
          a canvas. I like moving tiny squares around your screen.

          Light waves are freaking cool. Ripples of energy flinging through
          space letting us do all kinds of crazy things. The more we understand
          about them, the more we can do with them. Me? I particularly like
          APRS, the sending of digital packets over radio waves. Think GPS
          positioning reports, or text messaging. Just like your phone, but with
          technical control over every part of the process.

          I like to tinker with the magic I grew up around. (Don't tell me you
          weren't fascinated by cash registers as a child!) My idea of a good
          side-project (and ebay haul) has me starting with an thermal receipt
          printer and a RaspberryPi and ending up with a wifi-connected, AirPlay
          enabled greyscale thermal shopping-list and photo printer.

          Speaking of magic I grew up around-- my taste in video games remains
          the same as it always has been-- 2D, blocky, platforming, puzzlers all
          the way. Mario, Sonic, Tetris. My favorite game of all time? Link's
          Awakening for Game Boy.
