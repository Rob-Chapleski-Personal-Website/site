          My hobbies gravitate to the wide line between the highs and lows of
          technology. In this madly and rapidly advancing age of the
          cutting-edge and next big technological breakthrough, I love finding
          new places to toy with what are seen as today's basic and fundamental
          elements, which themselves served as the technological forefront of
          the recent past.

          With precise control of the smallest bits of space and time, we can
          build and tear down mountains. This is how I create-- one dot at a
          time. Seurat spent his Sunday afternoons with points of paint on a
          canvas. I like moving tiny squares around on the screen.
