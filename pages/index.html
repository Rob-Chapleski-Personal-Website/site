          Welcome to my site. Sometime soon, I'm going to put something pretty
          nifty here. Haven't figured out just what it is yet, but I will; don't
          you worry. Sorry for any disillusionment this may have imparted.
          Please go ahead and take a look around the rest of the site. There is
          still some work to do elsewhere, especially in terms of personal
          content. But the layout and interactivity of the site is at least
          functional, and I think it's pretty neat. It was a lot of fun to put
          together.
