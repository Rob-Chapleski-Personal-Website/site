          My hobbies gravitate together the highs and lows of technology. In
          this madly and rapidly advancing age of the cutting-edge and next big
          technological breakthrough, I love finding new comfortable places to
          toy with what are seen as today's basic and fundamental elements,
          which themselves served as the technological forefront of the recent
          past.

          I like to tinker with the magic I grew up around. (Don't tell me you
          weren't fascinated by cash registers as a child!) My idea of a good
          side-project (and ebay haul) has me starting with an thermal receipt
          printer and a RaspberryPi and ending up with a wifi-connected, AirPlay
          enabled greyscale thermal shopping-list and photo printer.

          Speaking of magic I grew up around-- my taste in video games remains
          the same as it always has been-- 2D, blocky, platforming, puzzlers all
          the way. Mario, Sonic, Tetris. My favorite game of all time? Link's
          Awakening for Game Boy.
